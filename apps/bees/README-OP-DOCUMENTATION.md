# OPERATORS

Description of operators available in a bees network, including list
of inputs and outputs. at bottom is a list of proposed ops yet to be
implemented.  if you're interested in developing new operators using
the C language, head to the bees development page.

# ACCUM
Accumulates input values to a stored number. Can be set to wrap the
count around the MIN and MAX values.
## Inputs
- INC: receives the number to add to the current VAL.
- VAL: sets the stored number’s current state.
- MIN: sets the minimum value for the stored number.
- MAX: sets the maximum value for the stored number.
- WRAP: if set, the output will wrap to opposing boundary when passing
  the MAX/MIN limit.
## Outputs
- VAL: outputs the current stored number whenever it changes.
- WRAP: when WRAP input is 1, sends a 0 whenever the count wraps to
  the opposing boundary. when WRAP input is 0, will output the amount
  by which the input exceeded the limit (aka overflow).

# ADC

See CV-IN

# ADD
Adds input A and input B. outputs the sum.
## Inputs
- A: added to input B and causes output.
- B: sets the value to be added to input A. does not cause output.
- B_TRIG: when 1, a new value sent to input B will also cause output.
## Outputs
- SUM: outputs the sum of A + B.

# ARC
Allows input from monome arc devices. Provides rudimentary led
feedback for further expansion. All outputs occur for any arc
movement.
## Inputs
- FOCUS: when 1 operator is active. when 0 operator ignores arc.
- LOOP: loopback mode. when set, rotating the encoder will set and
  display an internal value [0, 255]. when disabled, the leds and
  encoders are decoupled.
- RING: input selects which ring to send led data to [0, 2/4].
- POS: input selects which led to address in the selected ring
  [0, 63].
- VAL: input sends brightness value to selected led [0, 15].

so some pre-scaling (using MUL or DIV) may be necessary.

This op is useful for using decimal numbers as “storage” for many
binary numbers (on/off) which could be considered triggers, ie. for
drums. So decimal 3 is binary 00000011, which could mean play note 0
and note 1– decimal 13 is binary 00001101… note 0,2,3. etc.
