'beekeep' is a command-line bees emulator.

to build, you need to install the Jansson json-c library from http://www.digip.org/jansson/

beekeep reads and writes network states as JSON and can convert between json and .scn.

it also builds directly against the current bees sources, so it can function as a .scn converter between versuions of bees if necessary.

further functinonality is attendant on more implementation of the avr32_sim layer.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IMPORTANT

this is beekeep-0.3.8. use it on .scn files created with bees 0.3.x to convert them to JSON.
