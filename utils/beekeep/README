'beekeep' is a command-line bees emulator.

to build, you need to install the Jansson json-c library from http://www.digip.org/jansson/.

Jansson 2.2 is not compatible with beekeep but the current release 2.5 is compatible

beekeep reads and writes network states as JSON and can convert between json and .scn.

it also builds directly against the current bees sources, so it can function as a .scn converter between versions of bees if necessary.

further functionality is attendant on more implementation of the avr32_sim layer.
